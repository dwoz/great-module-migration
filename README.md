This repository contains the lists of modules (as well as states, runners, engines, etc) which will get removed from Salt.

A file can fall into one of three categories.

1. Files that are core to Salt and will remain in the Salt codebase
2. Files that will be moved out of the Salt codebase but continue to be maintained by the Salt Core Team
3. Files that will be moved out into a dump repository and will no longer be maintained by the Salt Core Team
